# Development

This repository is for the discussion of development ideas for the [NDSP](https://github.com/neurodsp-tools/neurodsp) tool for digital signal processing for neural data. 

The goal of this repository is to separate out code & maintenance questions for the `NeuroDSP` package from discussion of ideas and a place to organize on topics for new additions or suggested approaches that `NeuroDSP` should adopt. 

As a rule of thumb, if the idea or question is about the code in the project, it's likely a code or maintenance problem, whereas if it's idea is about the concepts and approach, it's likely a development idea, for our purposes. 

### Code or Maintenance Questions

Anything that relates to a bug report, an implementation question, requesting help for using the module, or a feature request that doesn't required a major update (for example, a new function in an existing module, or an extension of an existing functionality) is, for our purposes, considered a code or maintenance issue.

Code or maintenance questions should be directed to [issues page](https://github.com/neurodsp-tools/neurodsp/issues) of the [main repository](https://github.com/neurodsp-tools/neurodsp).

### Development Ideas

By development ideas, we mean ideas for a new tool or conceptual approach to be added or drastically changed in `NeuroDSP`. This can also include discussion of best practices and tutorial materials for how we want to recommend usage of the tool, and of DSP in neuroscience more generally. 

For example:
- significant changes to an underlying algorithm in the module, and how it works
- additions of new algorithms, functions or sub-modules to the package
- operating on different kind of data or inputs

For any ideas that fall into this category, please open an [issue](https://github.com/neurodsp-tools/development/issues) in this repository. 

Once an issue is opened, this repository can then be used by `NeuroDSP` developers to discuss and explore these ideas. If an idea is decided upon, a plan will be made for implementation, which can move to a fork or branch of the core repository, once the idea is translated into code tasks.
